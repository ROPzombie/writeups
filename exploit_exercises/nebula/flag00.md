### Task: Find Flag
####About
This level requires you to find a Set User ID program that will run as the “flag00” account. You could also find this by carefully looking in top level directories in / for suspicious looking directories.

Alternatively, look at the find man page.

To access this level, log in as level00 with the password of level00.

Source code
There is no source code available for this level

 * To find the flag we just have to search for the flag00

```bash
find / -executable -user flag00 2> /dev/null
```
Use find for the search. We can pimp that up, by using some arguaments.
This way find serches for executable files owned by user flag00 and everything else will be put out into /dev/null.

After doing so, we will get following results:
```bash
/bin/.../flag00
/home/flag00
/rofs/bin/.../flag00
/rofs/home/flag00```
So we run the file inside bins subdir.
```bash
level00@nebula:~$ /rofs/bin/.../flag00 
Congrats, now run getflag to get your flag!
```
And afterwards:
```bash
flag00@nebula:~$ getflag 
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```
Well the binaries will actually do nothing special, but change our user to from level00 to flag00.
 
So, we go on to level01/flag01!
